# AMLS2021

For both tasks the datasets shared on moodle have to be downloaded.
 http://shorturl.at/hquDP and the testing dataset provided)
 
Both codes run on Jupyter Notebook and all sections have to be ran to obtain final results.

To be able to run the code for both tasks, xls files have to be converted into csv files. 

The following paths in the code (in both tasks):
"C:\Users\melek\OneDrive\Belgeler\Year 4\AMLS\CW\dataset\image",
"C:\Users\melek\OneDrive\Belgeler\Year 4\AMLS\CW\dataset\label.csv",
"C:\Users\melek\OneDrive\Belgeler\Year 4\AMLS\CW\test\image",
"C:\Users\melek\OneDrive\Belgeler\Year 4\AMLS\CW\test\label.csv",

have to be replaced by the copied path the downloaded datasets have in the user's files:

...\dataset\image refers to the image file in : http://shorturl.at/hquDP

...\dataset\label.csv refers to the labels file in : http://shorturl.at/hquDP (converted to csv)

...\test\image" refers to the image file in the dataset provided for testing

...\test\label.csv" refers to the label file in the dataset provided for testing.
